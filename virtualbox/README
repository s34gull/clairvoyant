README for vboxheadless

vboxheadless is a collection of scripts that work with with Ubuntu's 
service manager to start/resume poweroff/saved VMs and suspend 
running/paused VMs on startup and shutdown of ths host. It consists of 
the following files:
   * vboxheadless [install in /etc/init.d]
   * start_vboxheadless.sh [install in /usr/local/bin]
   * start_vboxheadless_wrapper.sh [install in /usr/local/bin]
   * stop_vboxheadless.sh [install in /usr/local/bin]
   * stop_vboxheadless_wrapper.sh [install in /usr/local/bin]

You will need to create the following configuration file
   * /etc/vbox/headless.config

It MUST have the format [VM VRDP-Server-State VRDP-Server-Port] with no
comments:
<some-vm-name> <config|on|off> [<vrdp-port>]

An example file might look like:
my-vm-1 config
my-other-vm-2 on 3389
my-final-vm-3 off 

Each VM will be a separate line. Only include a port if you have 
specified the VRDP-Server-State as "on" (otherwise it will be ignored).
The recommended value for VRDP-Server-State is 'config'. See 
'man VBoxHeadless' for more information.

You MUST provide values for $USERAS and $LOG in the *_wrapper.sh scripts.
   * $USERAS controls the user as whom root will execute the start/stop.
     This user must own the named VMs and they must exist in the
     ~$USERAS/.VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml file
   * $LOG destination for all script output 

Once the files have been installed and configured, you'll need to run
   `sudo update-rc.d vboxheadless defaults 90` 

from a terminal. This will ensure that the vboxheadless script will be 
setup for startup/shutdown in all non-single-user runlevels, after the 
VirtualBox vboxdrv script has run (K20vboxdrv).
